## Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python 🧩

Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for effective problem-solving in data science. This section provides Python implementations of:

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms:** Binary Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), etc.
- **Data Structures:** Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, and more.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence, and more.
- **Complexity Analysis:** Understanding Big-O notation and optimizing code performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering 🔍

EDA and Feature Engineering are essential steps in the data science pipeline. This section covers:

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Data Visualization:** Identifying trends and patterns using different plots.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for reducing feature space.

## Matplotlib for Data Visualization 📉

Matplotlib is a versatile library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Here, you'll learn:

- **Basic Plots:** Line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, etc.
- **Advanced Plots:** Subplots, 3D plots, and custom styles.
- **Customization:** Titles, labels, legends, grids, and annotations to enhance plot readability.

## NumPy: The Foundation of Data Science 📐

NumPy is the core library for numerical computations in Python and is fundamental for data science. Topics covered:

- **Array Operations:** Creating, indexing, slicing, and reshaping arrays.
- **Mathematical Functions:** Element-wise operations, aggregations, and statistical functions.
- **Broadcasting and Vectorization:** Writing efficient and concise code.
- **Linear Algebra:** Matrix operations, eigenvalues, and more advanced mathematical computations.

## Pandas: Powerful Data Manipulation 🐼

Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. This section covers:

- **Data Structures:** Series and DataFrames for structured data manipulation.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing data, transforming data types, and dealing with duplicates.
- **Data Manipulation:** Grouping, merging, concatenating, and pivoting data.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Techniques for working with date and time data.

## Seaborn: Statistical Data Visualization 🌊

Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. Learn how to:
