## Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python

This section covers advanced concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms in Python. You'll find implementations and explanations for:

- Sorting Algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, etc.)
- Data Structures (Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Stacks, Queues, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering

EDA is a critical step in the data science process to understand the underlying patterns in data. This section covers:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and data formatting
- Data Visualization: Visualizing relationships and trends using various plots
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, etc.

## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a fundamental library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Here we cover:

- Basic plots: Line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, etc.
- Customizing plots: Titles, labels, legends, and colors
- Subplots and Layouts: Creating complex visualizations with multiple plots

## NumPy

NumPy is the foundational library for numerical computing in Python. This section dives deep into all concepts of NumPy relevant to data science:

- Array Manipulation: Creating, indexing, slicing, and reshaping arrays
- Mathematical Operations: Vectorization, broadcasting, and element-wise operations
- Statistical Functions: Mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
- Linear Algebra: Matrix operations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors

## Pandas

Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. This section covers:

- Data Structures: Series and DataFrames
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing data, duplicates, and inconsistent data types
- Data Manipulation: Merging, joining, concatenating, and reshaping data
- Time Series Analysis: Working with date-time data

## Seaborn

Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. Topics covered include:

- Plot Types: Boxplots, violin plots, pair plots, heatmaps, etc.
- Customizing Plots: Themes, palettes, and grids
- Advanced Visualizations: Using FacetGrid for multi-plot grids

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

This section covers the fundamentals and advanced concepts of OOP in Python:

- Classes and Objects: Creating and using classes and objects
- Inheritance: Single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance
- Polymorphism: Method overloading and overriding
- Encapsulation and Abstraction: Access modifiers and hiding implementation details
